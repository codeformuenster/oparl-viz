I don't know yet how to implement this and still have the\nAPI look beautiful. We also have to make sure that caching works correctly, as\nwe have to invalidate if either the `.js` or the `.js.map` file changes. My\nplan is to write a source-map-aware uglifier plugin to understand this use\ncase better, and then extract common code back into this `Filter` base class.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"joliss","email":"joliss42@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-05-03T17:38:54.912Z","created":"2014-02-10T23:17:58.671Z","0.0.1":"2014-02-10T23:17:58.671Z","0.1.0":"2014-02-24T13:47:02.775Z","0.1.1":"2014-03-06T01:00:51.449Z","0.1.2":"2014-03-12T17:55:59.193Z","0.1.3":"2014-03-13T12:27:55.382Z","0.1.4":"2014-03-13T22:11:03.677Z","0.1.5":"2014-04-02T09:21:23.206Z","0.1.6":"2014-04-05T02:21:47.815Z"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/joliss/broccoli-filter","repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/joliss/broccoli-filter"},"author":{"name":"Jo Liss","email":"joliss42@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/joliss/broccoli-filter/issues"},"license":"MIT","keywords":["broccoli-helper","filter","cache"],"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"ER80ULC4QY95L7A10IBXP7TMQ\""}
